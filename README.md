# pico-deej

This project contains the source code for a simple [deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej) volume mixer using a raspberry pi pico.  
Because the pico only has 3 analog inputs I use an ADS1015 for additional inputs.  

I might add some more elaborate features in the future, but for the time being just 5 potentiometers is all there is to it.
